# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the OpenMediaVault Plugins:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < Latest| :x:                |

**Note**: This project focuses on the latest version of plugins compatible with OpenMediaVault 7.x. Security updates are applied to the current release only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you find.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: **[maintainer-email]**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent to reporter
- **Day 3-7**: Initial triage and assessment
- **Day 8-30**: Investigation, fix development, and testing
- **Day 30+**: Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter)

## Security Best Practices

### For Plugin Developers

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Input Validation
- **Validate all user inputs** in web interfaces and RPC calls
- **Sanitize file paths** to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Escape output** to prevent XSS in web interfaces
- **Use parameterized queries** if database interactions are added

#### Docker Security
- **Use official Docker images** from trusted registries
- **Pin specific versions** rather than using `latest` tags
- **Run containers as non-root** when possible
- **Limit container capabilities** and resources
- **Keep base images updated** for security patches

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Follow OpenMediaVault's authentication mechanisms**
- **Implement proper session management**
- **Use role-based access control** where appropriate
- **Never hardcode credentials** or secrets

#### File System Security
- **Use appropriate file permissions** (644 for files, 755 for directories)
- **Validate file uploads** if implemented
- **Store sensitive data securely** outside web-accessible directories
- **Implement proper cleanup** of temporary files

### For System Administrators

#### Installation Security
- **Verify package integrity** before installation
- **Install from trusted sources** only
- **Keep OpenMediaVault system updated**
- **Monitor system logs** for suspicious activity

#### Runtime Security
- **Regularly update Docker images** used by plugins
- **Monitor container resource usage**
- **Implement network segmentation** where appropriate
- **Backup configurations** before plugin changes
- **Review plugin configurations** for exposed services

#### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS** for web interfaces when possible
- **Implement firewall rules** for exposed ports
- **Consider VPN access** for administrative interfaces
- **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **OpenMediaVault Integration**: Leverages OMV's existing security framework
- **Docker Isolation**: Services run in isolated containers
- **Privilege Separation**: RPC services run with limited privileges
- **Input Validation**: Web interfaces validate user inputs
- **Session Management**: Uses OMV's session handling

### Configuration Security

- **Environment Files**: Sensitive configuration stored in `.env` files
- **File Permissions**: Proper ownership and permissions on configuration files
- **Secret Generation**: Random secrets generated for services requiring them
- **Network Isolation**: Docker networks isolate service communication

## Known Security Considerations

### Docker Dependencies
- **Risk**: Plugins depend on Docker and Docker Compose security
- **Mitigation**: Users should keep Docker updated and follow Docker security best practices

### Exposed Ports
- **Risk**: Some plugins expose web interfaces on specific ports
- **Mitigation**: Document exposed ports clearly; users should implement appropriate firewall rules

### Shared Storage
- **Risk**: Plugins may access shared storage areas
- **Mitigation**: Follow principle of least privilege for file system access

### Third-party Images
- **Risk**: Plugins use third-party Docker images
- **Mitigation**: Use official images when possible; document image sources

## Incident Response

### If You Discover a Vulnerability

1. **Stop using the affected component** if actively exploited
2. **Document the vulnerability** with screenshots and logs
3. **Report immediately** using the process above
4. **Do not publicly disclose** until coordinated disclosure

### If You're Affected by a Vulnerability

1. **Check for security advisories** on the GitHub repository
2. **Update immediately** when patches are available
3. **Review logs** for signs of exploitation
4. **Consider temporary mitigations** if patches aren't available
5. **Report any evidence of exploitation** to maintainers
